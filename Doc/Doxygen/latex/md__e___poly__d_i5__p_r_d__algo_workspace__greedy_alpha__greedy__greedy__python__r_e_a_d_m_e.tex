The first step is to extract all of the TV programs during from at 06\+:00 AM to 02\+:00 AM of a next day. However, the TV program could be error-\/prone due to the nameing convention and it requires some filter rules as follows\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Ignore the program having duration is less then five minutes (\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}5 mins\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>});
\item Filter out any two programs are overlapped.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Sepcifically, given a list of the xml files, the collection.\+csv file will be generated as following.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Input\+: the list of XML file with filenames formatted yyyy-\/mm-\/dd\+\_\+\+HHMMSS.\+xml
\item Ouput\+: The list of TV programs that provided for each day based on the name of the XML file.
\end{DoxyItemize}

For example\+:

Input\+: The file 2022-\/01-\/01\+\_\+100000.\+xml

Ouput\+: List of TV programs which its starts FROM at 06\+:00\+:00 01-\/01-\/2022 TO at 02\+:00\+:00 02-\/01-\/2022

Notes\+: Using SHA-\/1 hash function for robustness of TV titles.
